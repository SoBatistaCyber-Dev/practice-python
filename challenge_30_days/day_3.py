'''
    Remove first n characters from a string

    Write a Python code to remove characters from a string from 0 to n and return a new string.

    For Example:

        remove_chars("PYnative", 4) so output must be tive. Here, you need to remove the first four characters from a string.
        remove_chars("PYnative", 2) so output must be native. Here, you need to remove the first two characters from a string.

    Note: n must be less than the length of the string.
